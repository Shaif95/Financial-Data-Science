The code is written in Jupyter on my local PC. The datareaders need 1 min break between API calls. I have used TINGIO 
for HFT and AV Daily for Daily stock data. The API keys need to be replaced (I believe). 

The plots are generated using functions with multiple parameters iterated over a loop. The plots are generated
using matplotlib. Please let me know if you have problems reproducing the results or have any other question.
