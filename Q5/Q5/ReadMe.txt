Their are four noteboks for 1. BTC option mark-iv 2. BTC_Option ask_iv. 3. OptionData12110 4. EuropeanOptionCleanData 

The code is initially written for BTC data, so the results are probably better with the BTC data. 

Both HL and Adaptive learning is done for all the  Machine learning methods along with HL for feature interpolation, gaussian, kernel and PCA.

The results can be verified by running the code in the notebooks. The comments are on 1. btc_option notebook, so I'd suggest running that first.
